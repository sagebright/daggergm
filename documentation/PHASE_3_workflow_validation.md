## 📝 Tasks

### Task 1: Validate Workflow Syntax

**Before testing, ensure workflow is valid**:

```bash
# Install workflow validation tool
brew install actionlint  # macOS
# OR
curl -L https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint/releases/latest/download/actionlint_linux_amd64.tar.gz | tar xz
sudo mv actionlint /usr/local/bin/

# Validate workflow syntax
actionlint .github/workflows/ci.yml

# Expected: No errors
# If errors, fix before continuing
```

**Alternative validation** (using GitHub API):

```bash
# Check if workflow is recognized by GitHub
gh workflow list

# Expected: Should show "CI/CD Pipeline"
```

---

### Task 2: Test Scenario 1 - Documentation-Only Changes

**Goal**: Verify documentation changes skip CI entirely

```bash
# Make a documentation-only change
echo "## Testing CI Skip" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "docs: test documentation skip"
git push origin main
```

**Validation using MCP**:

```
Ask Claude:
"Show me the latest GitHub Actions run for daggergm"

Expected: No new run triggered, or run was skipped
Time: 0 minutes (instant)
```

**Validation using CLI** (if MCP not working):

```bash
gh run list --limit 1

# Expected: Either no new run, or status shows "skipped"
```

**✅ Success Criteria**:

- No workflow run triggered, OR
- Workflow run shows "skipped" status
- Takes < 10 seconds

---

### Task 3: Test Scenario 2 - Manual Skip with [skip ci]

**Goal**: Verify `[skip ci]` flag works

```bash
# Make a code change with [skip ci]
echo "// test skip ci" >> app/page.tsx
git add app/page.tsx
git commit -m "test: verify [skip ci] works [skip ci]"
git push origin main
```

**Validation using MCP**:

```
Ask Claude:
"What's the status of the latest CI run? Was it skipped?"

Expected: Run was skipped or not triggered
```

**Validation using CLI**:

```bash
gh run list --limit 1

# Expected: No new run, or status "skipped"
```

**✅ Success Criteria**:

- Workflow skipped despite code change
- `[skip ci]` flag respected

---

### Task 4: Test Scenario 3 - Lint-Only Changes

**Goal**: Verify lint-only changes are fast

```bash
# Make a formatting change
npx prettier --write app/page.tsx
git add app/page.tsx
git commit -m "style: format page.tsx"
git push origin main
```

**Monitor using MCP**:

```
Ask Claude:
"Watch the current GitHub Actions run and tell me when it completes"

Expected: Should complete in ~5 minutes (only lint/typecheck)
```

**Monitor using CLI**:

```bash
gh run watch

# Expected:
# - lint-and-typecheck: ~3-5 min ✅
# - test-unit: skipped (no code changes)
# - test-e2e: skipped (no code changes)
# - build: runs (required)
# Total: ~7-8 minutes
```

**✅ Success Criteria**:

- Completes in < 10 minutes
- Only lint, typecheck, and build run
- Tests skipped (no logic changes)

---

### Task 5: Test Scenario 4 - Full Test Suite

**Goal**: Verify complete workflow with all jobs

```bash
# Make a meaningful code change
cat >> app/page.tsx << 'EOF'

// Test full CI pipeline
export const metadata = {
  description: 'Testing CI/CD pipeline',
};
EOF

git add app/page.tsx
git commit -m "feat: test full CI pipeline"
git push origin main
```

**Monitor using MCP**:

```
Ask Claude:
"Monitor the GitHub Actions run and give me a summary when complete"

Expected: Claude watches run and reports status
```

**Monitor using CLI**:

```bash
# Watch in real-time
gh run watch

# Or check status periodically
watch -n 10 "gh run view --log-failed"
```

**✅ Success Criteria**:

- All jobs run: lint-and-typecheck, test-unit, test-e2e, build
- test-unit includes auto-retry (`--retry=2`)
- Coverage enforced (90% threshold)
- E2E tests run in parallel
- Total time: ~20-25 minutes
- All jobs pass

---

### Task 6: Verify Auto-Retry Logic

**Goal**: Ensure flaky tests retry automatically

**Check test output**:

```bash
# View detailed logs from latest run
gh run view --log

# Search for retry indicators
gh run view --log | grep -i "retry"

# Expected: Should see retry messages if any test was flaky
```

**Using MCP**:

```
Ask Claude:
"Show me the test logs from the latest run. Were any tests retried?"

Expected: Claude shows if any tests needed retries
```

**✅ Success Criteria**:

- If test fails first time, automatically retries
- Test marked as passed if succeeds on retry
- Logs show retry attempts

---

### Task 7: Test Coverage Enforcement

**Goal**: Verify 90% coverage threshold is enforced

**Temporary test** (will fail intentionally):

```bash
# Temporarily lower coverage threshold to test enforcement
sed -i '' 's/COVERAGE < 90/COVERAGE < 100/' .github/workflows/ci.yml
git add .github/workflows/ci.yml
git commit -m "test: verify coverage enforcement"
git push origin main

# Wait for run to fail
gh run watch
```

**Validation**:

```
Ask Claude:
"Show me why the latest CI run failed"

Expected: "Coverage below 100% threshold"
```

**Restore**:

```bash
# Restore correct threshold
sed -i '' 's/COVERAGE < 100/COVERAGE < 90/' .github/workflows/ci.yml
git add .github/workflows/ci.yml
git commit -m "fix: restore 90% coverage threshold"
git push origin main
```

**✅ Success Criteria**:

- Run fails when coverage below threshold
- Error message clearly states coverage issue
- Subsequent run passes with correct threshold

---

### Task 8: Test Deployment Trigger

**Goal**: Verify deployment only triggers on main branch after all tests pass

**Test 1: Feature branch (should NOT deploy)**:

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b test/deployment
echo "// test" >> app/page.tsx
git add app/page.tsx
git commit -m "test: deployment trigger"
git push origin test/deployment
```

**Validation**:

```
Ask Claude:
"Did the latest CI run include a deployment step?"

Expected: No - feature branches don't deploy
```

**Test 2: Main branch (should deploy)**:

```bash
# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge test/deployment
git push origin main
```

**Validation**:

```
Ask Claude:
"Show me the deployment status from the latest run"

Expected: Deployment triggered after all tests passed
```

**Using Vercel MCP**:

```
Ask Claude:
"Show me the latest Vercel deployment for daggergm"

Expected: New deployment in progress or completed
```

**✅ Success Criteria**:

- Feature branches don't trigger deployment
- Main branch triggers deployment
- Deployment only happens if all tests pass
- Vercel shows new deployment

---

### Task 9: Test Supabase MCP Integration

**Goal**: Verify database access via MCP

**Test 1: List projects**:

```

**Test 2: Query database**:

```
Ask Claude:
"Execute this SQL query on the DaggerGM test database:
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'"

Expected: Lists database tables
```

**Test 3: Check RLS policies**:

```
Ask Claude:
"Check which tables in DaggerGM database are missing RLS policies"

Expected: Lists tables and their RLS status
```

**✅ Success Criteria**:

- Can list projects
- Can execute SQL queries

  | jq '[.[] | .durationMs] | add / length / 60000'

# Expected: ~20-22 minutes average
```

**Using MCP**:

```
Ask Claude:
"Show me the duration of the last 10 workflow runs.
What's the average duration?"

Expected: Average ~20-22 minutes
```

**Document results**:

```bash
cat >> documentation/CI_CD_PERFORMANCE.md << 'EOF'
# CI/CD Performance Metrics

## Baseline (Before Optimization)
- Full test suite: ~25 minutes
- Documentation changes: ~25 minutes (wasted)

2. Lint fixes only: ~7 min (lint + build)
3. Code changes (no tests needed): ~12 min
4. Full test suite: ~20 min
5. With E2E tests: ~22 min

## Historical Data
EOF

# Append actual run data
gh run list --limit 20 --json number,displayTitle,conclusion,durationMs \
  | jq -r '.[] | "\(.number),\(.displayTitle),\(.conclusion),\(.durationMs/60000)"' \
  >> documentation/CI_CD_PERFORMANCE.md
```

**✅ Success Criteria**:

- Full suite runs in ~20 minutes (vs 25 before)
- Documentation changes take 0 minutes (vs 25 before)
- 40-50% overall time savings achieved

### Task 13: Create Monitoring Dashboard

**Goal**: Document common monitoring commands

**Create file**: `documentation/CI_CD_MONITORING.md`

```markdown
# CI/CD Monitoring Guide

## Quick Status Checks

### Using GitHub MCP (Recommended)

\`\`\`
Claude Commands:
"What's the status of the latest CI run?"
"Show me failing tests from the latest run"
"List recent deployments"
"Monitor the current workflow and notify me when complete"
\`\`\`

### Using GitHub CLI

\`\`\`bash

# Current status

gh run list --limit 5

# Watch current run

gh run watch

# View logs

gh run view --log

# Failed jobs only

gh run view --log-failed
\`\`\`

## Performance Monitoring

### Average Duration

\`\`\`bash

# Last 20 runs average

gh run list --limit 20 --json durationMs \\
| jq '[.[] | .durationMs] | add / length / 60000'
\`\`\`

### Success Rate

\`\`\`bash

# Last 50 runs

gh run list --limit 50 --json conclusion \\
| jq '[.[] | select(.conclusion == "success")] | length'
\`\`\`

## Deployment Monitoring

### Using Vercel MCP

\`\`\`
Claude Commands:
"Show latest Vercel deployment status"
"What's the build time for recent deployments?"
"Show me deployment logs"
\`\`\`

### Using Vercel Dashboard

https://vercel.com/sagebright/daggergm/deployments

## Database Monitoring

### Using Supabase MCP

\`\`\`
Claude Commands:
"Show me tables in DaggerGM database"
"Execute: SELECT COUNT(\*) FROM adventures"
"Check RLS policy coverage"
\`\`\`

## Alert Thresholds

Set up alerts for:

- Run duration > 30 minutes (something is stuck)
- Success rate < 95% (flaky tests)
- Coverage < 90% (quality degradation)
- Deployment failures

## Troubleshooting

### Run taking too long

1. Check if tests are stuck (timeout should catch)
2. Check for database connection issues
3. Verify no infinite loops in tests

### Tests failing in CI but not locally

1. Check environment variables
2. Verify test database is accessible
3. Check timezone differences (CI uses UTC)
4. Review full logs: \`gh run view --log\`

### Deployment not triggering

1. Verify on main branch: \`git branch\`
2. Check all tests passed
3. Verify VERCEL_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL secret exists
4. Check Vercel dashboard for errors
   \`\`\`
