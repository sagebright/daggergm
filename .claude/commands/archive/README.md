# Archived Commands

This directory contains outdated slash commands that are no longer part of the active DaggerGM workflow.

## Archived on 2025-10-23

### PRP Workflow Commands (Outdated)

These commands were from an earlier workflow pattern that has been replaced by more systematic approaches:

- **execute-prp_daggergm.md** - Old PRP execution workflow
- **generate-prp_daggergm.md** - Old PRP generation workflow

**Reason for archival**: These commands used an outdated workflow pattern that doesn't align with the current DaggerGM development practices. They have been replaced by:

- `/execute-feature` - For feature implementation with TDD
- `/execute-db-ops` - For database operations
- `/execute-ops` - For general operations

## Archive Policy

1. Preserve historical context
2. Allow reference if needed
