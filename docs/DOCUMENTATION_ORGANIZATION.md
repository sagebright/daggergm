## Documentation Access Guide

### For Active Development

1. **Start here**: Root `CLAUDE.md` - complete development guide
2. **CI/CD info**: `documentation/GITHUB_ACTIONS.md`
3. **Commands**: `.claude/commands/README.md` - command usage
4. **Skills**: `.claude/skills/README.md` - skill descriptions

### For Reference

1. **Architecture decisions**: `documentation/STATE_MANAGEMENT_DECISION.md`
2. **Testing philosophy**: `documentation/TESTING_STRATEGY.md`
3. **Guest system**: `documentation/GUEST_SYSTEM.md`
4. **Security setup**: `documentation/SECRETS_SETUP.md`
5. **Server state**: `documentation/SERVER_STATE.md`

### For Historical Context

- **Archived docs**: `documentation/archive/` - completed phases and setup guides

---

## Rationale for Organization

### Why Archive These Documents?

- **Completion**: Phase documents for setup tasks that are now complete
- **Reference**: MCP setup is done, docs preserved for troubleshooting only
- **Superseded**: Setup guides completed, infrastructure now active
- **Clarity**: Reduce confusion between active vs reference documentation

### Why Archive DaggerGM/ Folder? (Updated 2025-10-24)

- **Rebuild phase complete**: The "rebuild from scratch" planning is done - project is now actively being built
- **Templates implemented**: Config files, commands, and skills now exist in root project
- **Valuable docs promoted**: Architecture decisions moved to `documentation/` root for easier access
- **Preserved for reference**: Entire folder archived with all templates and examples intact
